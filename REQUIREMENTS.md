# Music Collaboration Platform - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

A web-based collaborative music creation platform that enables musicians to work together in real-time, with AI-powered assistance for music composition and arrangement.

## Core Vision

Create an online musical application where users can pair up in a collaborative environment to create music together, with AI assistance for various music production tasks including MIDI generation and chord progressions.

## Phase 1: MVP Features

### Core Functionality
- **Simple DAW Interface**: Basic digital audio workstation interface optimized for web
- **MIDI Support**: Full support for MIDI segments creation, editing, and playback
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously
- **AI Assistant Integration**: ChatGPT-powered tool calls for music creation tasks

### AI-Powered Features
- **MIDI Segment Generation**: AI can create MIDI patterns based on user prompts
- **Chord Progression Creation**: Generate chord progressions in various styles and keys
- **Musical Suggestions**: AI provides compositional suggestions and improvements
- **Style Analysis**: AI can analyze and suggest modifications to match specific genres

### Collaboration Features
- **User Pairing**: System to match users for collaborative sessions
- **Project Synchronization**: Changes made by one user are synchronized to collaborators (not real-time performance)
- **Synchronized Playback**: "Snap" feature to synchronize play/pause across all collaborators for listening together
- **Session Management**: Create, join, and manage collaborative music sessions
- **Communication**: Basic chat or communication system for collaborators

### Technical Requirements
- **Web-based**: Accessible through modern web browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Event Synchronization**: Synchronize user actions (play/pause, project changes) rather than audio streams
- **MIDI Compatibility**: Support for standard MIDI file formats

## Phase 2: Future Expansion

### Enhanced Audio Support
- **Audio File Support**: Import, edit, and mix audio files alongside MIDI
- **Multi-track Recording**: Record audio directly in the application
- **Audio Effects**: Basic effects processing (reverb, delay, EQ, etc.)
- **Sample Library**: Built-in library of samples and loops

### Advanced Collaboration
- **Project Management**: Version control and project history
- **Multiple Simultaneous Collaborators**: Support for larger groups
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different access levels (composer, mixer, etc.)
- **Asynchronous Collaboration**: Work on projects when collaborators are offline

### AI Enhancements
- **Advanced Composition**: AI can create full arrangements
- **Mixing Assistance**: AI-powered mixing and mastering suggestions
- **Genre-specific AI**: Specialized AI models for different musical styles
- **Voice Generation**: AI vocal synthesis and harmonization

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Frontend
- modern web framework (VueJS)
- Web Audio API for audio processing
- WebRTC for real-time collaboration
- Canvas or WebGL for waveform visualization

### Backend
- Event synchronization server (WebSocket-based for user actions)
- User authentication and session management
- AI service integration (OpenAI API)
- File storage and project persistence

### AI Integration
- OpenAI API for natural language processing
- Music theory engine for chord progression generation
- MIDI manipulation libraries
- Pattern recognition for musical analysis

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Number of collaborative sessions created
- Average session duration
- User retention rate
- Projects completed collaboratively

### AI Effectiveness
- AI suggestion acceptance rate
- User satisfaction with AI-generated content
- Reduction in composition time with AI assistance

### Technical Performance
- Event synchronization latency (target: <200ms for user actions)
- Application load time
- Concurrent user capacity
- System uptime and reliability

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Network Reliability**: Event synchronization depends on stable connections
- **Browser Compatibility**: Web Audio API support varies
- **Scale Challenges**: Supporting many concurrent users
- **AI Reliability**: Ensuring consistent AI-generated content quality

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning Curve**: DAW interfaces can be complex for beginners
- **Collaboration Friction**: Coordinating multiple users effectively
- **AI Over-reliance**: Users becoming too dependent on AI assistance

### Business Risks
- **Market Competition**: Existing DAW and collaboration tools
- **AI Costs**: OpenAI API usage costs at scale
- **User Acquisition**: Building initial user base for collaboration features

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Functional MIDI Editor**: Users can create, edit, and play MIDI sequences
2. **Project Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same project with changes synchronized
3. **Synchronized Playback**: Users can "snap" their playback together to listen simultaneously
4. **AI Integration**: At least one AI feature (chord progressions or MIDI generation) working
5. **Session Management**: Users can create and join collaborative sessions

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Technical Stack**: Choose specific frameworks and tools
2. **Create Wireframes**: Design the user interface and user experience
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Initialize project structure
4. **Implement Core Features**: Start with MIDI editor and basic collaboration
5. **AI Integration**: Implement ChatGPT integration for music generation
6. **Testing and Iteration**: User testing and feature refinement
